# 🧠 C Programming Practice

This repository contains my practice code, small projects, and exercises written in the C programming language. It serves as a personal learning log and reference.

## 🛠 Contents

The code is organized into categories for clarity:
C_Programming/
├── Basics/ # Hello world, data types, input/output
├── ControlFlow/ # If-else, switch, loops
├── Functions/ # Function usage, recursion
├── Arrays/ # 1D/2D arrays, string handling
├── Pointers/ # Pointer basics, pointer arithmetic
├── Structures/ # Structs, unions, typedefs
├── Files/ # File handling
└── MiniProjects/ # Small projects like calculator, to-do list, etc.


## 🚀 Goals

- Strengthen C fundamentals
- Practice writing clean and efficient code
- Explore basic data structures and memory handling in C
- Work on small terminal-based projects


## 🚀 Topics Covered
- Basics of C syntax and structure
- Control statements (if, loops, switch)
- Functions and recursion
- Arrays, strings, pointers
- Structures and memory management
- File handling
- Mini projects (optional)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- `make` (optional for automation)
- VS Code / Vim / any preferred IDE

## 📌 How to Compile & Run

To compile a program:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output

## For debugging:
gcc -g filename.c -o output
gdb output

Or use make if available:
make filename

Happy coding in C! 🐚
